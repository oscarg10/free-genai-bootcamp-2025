## Formatting Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:

vocabulary table
sentence structure
clues and considerations

## Vocabulary Table

the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
the table of of vocabular should only have the following columns: German and English
Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
ensure there are no repeats eg. if the verb "sind" is repeated twice, show it only once
if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

## Sentence Structure

do not provide particles in the sentence structure
do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.

The bird is black. → [Subject] [Verb] [Adjective]
The raven is in the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location]
Put the garbage in the garden. → [Verb] [Object] [Location]
Did you see the raven? → [Verb] [Subject] [Object]?
This morning, I saw the raven. → [Time] [Verb] [Subject] [Object]
Are you going? → [Verb] [Subject]?
Did you eat the food? → [Verb] [Subject] [Object]?
The raven is looking at the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Separable Prefix]
The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location], [Conjunction] [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Separable Prefix]
I saw the raven because it was loud. → [Subject] [Verb] [Object], [Conjunction] [Subject] [Complement] [Verb]


## Clues and Considerations

try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
talk about the vocabulary but leave out the german words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
Do not reveal the answer when giving out clues. 
Be short and concise with additional clues.
