## Functional Requirements

The company ideantified weaknesses with the current language learning platforms. Therefore, the decided to leverage the power of GenAI to put together an application that will improve the quality and user experience of an user when learning a new language. 

This platform will be specifically used by individuals who moved to Germany and are interested in learning German. To do so, the company needs to invest in modern infrastructure since the GenAI models will require higher performance as well as memory. For the investment, the responsible stakeholders budgeted around 15,000EU. 

## Risks

Since GenAI is a fairly new field, there are a lot of security concerns due to the data regulations within Germany. These regulations are more strict than in other countries. As such, we as a company must plan on the implementation of adecuate guardrails to prevent any data leakage from happening. On top of it, we must stay proactive with the design of the application to avoid any security gaps/vulnerabilities. 

## Contraints

Due to the size of the company, there is a very limited budget which will need to be efficiently used to avoid any waste of resources. Shareholders are willing to enable additional funds if we can show the right demand for the service as well as the success of the application.
