# Implementation Plan: POST /study_sessions Route

## 1. Setup the Route

- [x] 1.1: Define a new route in the load(app) function for handling POST /api/study-sessions.
- [x] 1.2: Use @cross_origin() to allow cross-origin requests.
- [x] 1.3: Extract group_id and study_activity_id from the request JSON body.
- [x] 1.4: Validate that both fields are provided and are integers.

## 2. Database Interaction

- [x] 2.1: Open a database cursor using app.db.cursor().
- [x] 2.2: Validate that group_id exists in the groups table.
- [x] 2.3: Validate that study_activity_id exists in the study_activities table.
- [x] 2.4: If either does not exist, return a 400 Bad Request response.
- [x] 2.5: Insert a new row into the study_sessions table with:
  - group_id
  - study_activity_id
  - created_at as the current timestamp.
- [x] 2.6: Retrieve the id of the newly created study session.
- [x] 2.7: Commit the transaction to save the changes.

## 3. Response Handling

- [x] 3.1: Return a 201 Created response with the new study session data:
  - id
  - group_id
  - study_activity_id
  - created_at

## 4. Error Handling

- [x] 4.1: Catch database errors and return a 500 Internal Server Error response.
- [x] 4.2: Catch validation errors and return a 400 Bad Request response.
- [x] 4.3: Ensure the database connection is properly closed in case of failure.

## 5. Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] 5.1: Test successful session creation with valid group_id and study_activity_id.
- [ ] 5.2: Test failure when group_id is missing.
- [ ] 5.3: Test failure when study_activity_id is missing.
- [ ] 5.4: Test failure when group_id does not exist in the database.
- [ ] 5.5: Test failure when study_activity_id does not exist in the database.
- [ ] 5.6: Test failure when sending invalid data types.

### Integration Tests
- [ ] 5.7: Send a valid POST /api/study-sessions request and verify the response.
- [ ] 5.8: Send a request with missing fields and verify the error response.
- [ ] 5.9: Send a request with non-existent group_id and study_activity_id and verify the error response.
